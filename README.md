# Debouncing-Throttling-Examples

# Debounce and Throttling Example Application

A React application demonstrating the practical implementation of debouncing and throttling techniques in real-world scenarios. This project showcases how these performance optimization techniques can be used to handle frequent events efficiently.

## Features

### 1. Debouncing Example
- Real-time search functionality with debounced API calls
- Demonstrates how debouncing prevents excessive API calls while typing
- Shows the difference between debounced and non-debounced behavior
- Visual feedback showing the number of API calls made

### 2. Throttling Example
- Manual refresh functionality with throttled API calls
- Demonstrates how throttling limits the rate of API calls
- Shows the difference between throttled and non-throttled behavior
- Visual feedback showing the throttling effect

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React.js
- **UI Components**: Reactstrap
- **Routing**: React Router
- **Styling**: SCSS
- **API Integration**: RESTful API calls

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### Debouncing
- Implementation of debounce hook
- Handling user input events
- API call optimization
- State management
- Error handling

### Throttling
- Implementation of throttle hook
- Rate limiting
- API call optimization
- State management
- Error handling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/debounce-example-app.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd debounce-example-app
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

## Usage Examples

### Debouncing Example
```javascript
// Example of using the debounced search
const debouncedSearchTerm = useDebounced(searchTerm, 500);
```

### Throttling Example
```javascript
// Example of using the throttled refresh
const throttledRefreshTrigger = useThrottledValue(refreshTrigger, 2000);
```

## Best Practices Demonstrated
